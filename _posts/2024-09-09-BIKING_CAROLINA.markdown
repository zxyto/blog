back in August I set out to explore a few trails and such around in the Carolinas.

I decided to take things slow and picked a route by Kings Mountain State Park which I found on Ride With GPS. The start of the route was in NC in a parking lot near the Crowders state park whch then takes you into SC and into the Kings Mountain park on a paved road. After about 20 minutes on the paved road I got bored and decided to detour onto the Apple Rd. This was a fund couple of miles of gravel which was resonably scenic.

A few days later wandered out to Sumter National Forest and decided to tackle a route starting at the camp ground near Brickhouse cross roads that I found on Ride With GPS. The gravel sections follow national forest roads and are fairly flat and were well suited for an endurance style ride. The one thing I did not enjoy was the brief stretch of state highway connecting the two segements of gravel... semi trucks don't really seem to value life...
