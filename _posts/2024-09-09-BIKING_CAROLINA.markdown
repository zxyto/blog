Earlier this month I set out to explore a few trails and such around in the Carolinas. I wandered out to Sumter National Forest and decided to tackle a route starting at the camp ground near Brickhouse cross roads that I found on Ride With GPS. The gravel sections follow national forest roads and are fairly flat and were well suited for an endurance style ride. The one thing I did not enjoy was the brief stretch of state highway connecting the two segements of gravel... semi trucks don't really seem to value life...
